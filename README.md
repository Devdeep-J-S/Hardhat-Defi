# Defi Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

## Project Setup

yarn install
yarn hardhat run scripts/aaveBorrow.js

1. Deposit Colateral : ETH / WETH
2. Borrow : DAI
3. Repay : DAI
4. Withdraw Colateral : ETH / WETH (future scope)
